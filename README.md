## 1. Mini world and Description

In this modern era of online shopping, no seller wants to be left behind, moreover, due to its simplicity the shift from offline selling model to an online selling model is witnessing a rampant growth.<br>
Therefore, as an engineer, our job is to ease the path of this transition for the seller.
Amongst many things that an online site requires the most important is a database system. Hence in this project, I am planning to design a database where small clothing sellers can sell their products online.

## 2. Basic Structure

### 2.1 Functional requirement

- A new user can register on the website.
- A customer can see details of the product present in the cart
- A customer can view his order history.
- Admin can start a sale with a certain discount on every product.
- Customers can filter the product based on the product details.
- A customer can add or delete a product from the cart.
- A seller can unregister/ stop selling his product.
- A seller/ customer can update his details.
- Admin can view the products purchased on a particular date.
- Admin can view a number of products sold on a particular date.
- A customer can view the total price of the product present in the cart unpurchased.
- Admin can view details of the customer who have not purchased anything.
- Admin can view total profit earned from the website.
- Admin can add sealeman details.
- Admin can details of shipping.
- Admin can see details of active and inactive clients/customers.

     select pay_amt into amt 
     from payment_one
     where pay_customer_id=customerid;
     IF amt >0 then 
     SET amtlimit ='doing well';
     ELSE 
     SET amtlimit='not doing well';
     END IF;
     END $$
     delimiter ;

     DECLARE customer_city VARCHAR(100);
     SELECT user_city
     INTO customer_city FROM
     app_user_two
     WHERE
     user_email_id = Customerid;
     CASE customer_city
     WHEN  'pune' THEN
     SET Shipping = '2-day Shipping';
     WHEN 'nashik' THEN
     SET Shipping = '3-day Shipping';
     ELSE
     SET Shipping = '5-day Shipping';
     END CASE;
     END$$
     delimiter ;
- calling procedure
     call Get_Customer_Shipping(1,@shipping);
     select @shipping;
     

```
